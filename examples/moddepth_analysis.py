'''
Example python script using anlffr functions, meant to be called from the
command line.  This was originally created to analyze data from a Brainvision
EEG system that was already preprocessed in Matlab. There were three conditions
with two polarities each, stored in files of the form
'subjectname_S_trgger.mat', where trigger is 1:12, and only triggers 1-3
(positive polarity) and 7-9 (negative polarity) are of interest. Epochs were
400 ms long.

This generates a .csv file with the results after bootstrapping in an
"Excel-friendly" format. See moddepth_analysis_results_example.csv for sample
output.

command line usage:
$ python moddepth_analysis.py dataDir saveDir subject001 [...]

where [...] are inputs for additional subjects.
